        codecanyon
        evanto
        themeforest
        dribble - images
        pininterest - images

        - Images
        -contacts
- Identify what we need more info. if any thing need ask Your Manager

Step 2: Find any free templates available to suit your Requirements - for Beginners
    - Why we need to take template
        - if you are ui designer , do from scratch
        - if not, take template and do changes accordingly Because it will take 1 week-1 month for 1 page (If you are not sound in skills)

    Note: Identify you strengths and Do accordings.
